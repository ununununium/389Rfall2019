## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the ELMS assignment.

### Part 2 (75 pts)

1. I will tell my boss immediately. If my boss does not do anything for fixing the problem, I will tell consumer watchdog, they will help me push my boss to do something to fix the problem. If the above approaches still not working, I will tell the public in a legal way. I will not tell the public directly because there might be some bad people who want to exploit the problem and cause an even worse consequence.

2. Unless my boss does any action to fix the problem, I will keep on telling him how severe the problem is and how terrible the result might be if the problem is not fixed. If my company refuses to postpone ECU's release, I will quit my job and try to convince my colleague to stop working on the current. I have to try my best to stop the ECU from releasing because I know that once this problematic ECU released, there must be tragedy happening one day.

3. I am definitely responsible for the bad results if I do nothing. Because I am the developer of this problematic ECU, I and my team build the ECU and the tragedy.
