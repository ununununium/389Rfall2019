## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (100 pts)
Answer the following questions regarding the server executable (for which source is provided).

1. How is the per-session administrator password generated? Are there any inherent weaknesses in this implementation?

  The per-session administrator password is generated by the seed of time. The weakness is if the hacker knows when the exact time victim access the server, the hacker would be able to generate that password.  

2. Describe two vulnerabilities in this program. Provide specific line numbers and classifications of the vulnerability. Explain potential ramifications as well as ways to avoid these vulnerabilities when writing code.
  - ```server.c[46]``` ```Format String vulnerability```. If user input string is ```"%p"```, the ```printf()``` will print the address on the stack. The number of ``"%p"`` user passed in will be the same as the number of addresses ```printf()``` will spit out. Once you have this ability to what is going on on the stack, you can basically see any thing from this program.

  - ```server.c[68]``` ```Buffer Overflow vulnerability```.


3. What is the flag?

4. Describe the process you followed to obtain the flag: vulnerabilities exploited, your inputs to the server in a human-readable format, etc. If you create any helper code please include it.
